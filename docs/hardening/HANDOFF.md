# Hand-over between the four pre-launch campaign sessions

The final pre-launch campaign is split into four Claude Code sessions that run one after another,
each owning one slice of the product: **session 1** tenancy, roles, plans, seats, billing and usage
limits (the money and access model); **session 2** documents, AI and every engine, the whole
document-to-decision pipeline and every background job; **session 3** the organization, identity
and governance consoles, settings truthfulness and the security red team; **session 4** the
product shell and experience, performance, operations, end-to-end customer journeys and launch
certification. A session that finds a defect in another session's slice fixes it when that takes
under about 30 minutes; otherwise it writes it here, under the session that owns it, with enough
detail to reproduce. Each session appends a section "Session N → later sessions" when it finishes:
what it changed that later sessions must build on (limits, capability keys, metered keys,
migrations, renamed routes, shared components), defects it saw in their slices, and what in its
own slice is unfinished, with why.

## Owner request: the one-week trial (must be built in a later session)

The owner decided on 2026-10-11 (NEEDS-OWNER.md **N-052**, superseding the trial part of N-051) that
**Free is a one-week trial; when it ends the organization is asked to subscribe to a paid plan**, as
Claude does. Session 1 recorded it but did not build it. **Session 2 builds it** (ending a trial
stops uploads, the assistant, automations and engine work, which session 2 owns); **session 3**
checks the consoles, emails and settings it adds; **session 4** proves the whole journey (sign up →
trial → reminder → trial ends → subscribe → everything back) in the browser and certifies it. The
spec, with what already exists to build on:
1. **Clock.** One trial per owner account, starting when the person creates their first
   organization (`organization_service._start_on_free_plan` is the moment; the Free pool,
   `quota_service.usage_pool`, already groups an owner's organizations). Store when it ends
   (for example `users.trial_ends_at`, or on the pool's anchor organization) in a migration after
   `s1b1_calendar_feed_org_member`; length from a setting `FREE_TRIAL_DAYS = 7`.
2. **Gate, server side, every path.** After the end, without a live paid subscription: refuse new
   work with a 402 `TRIAL_ENDED` (`remedy: SUBSCRIBE`, `trial_ended_at`) in `plan_admission`
   (documents, re-processing, assistant, workspaces), in `app/api/billing_write_gate.py` (the
   read-only write gate, so every write route refuses the same way), and in
   `app/workers/tenant_gate.unpaid_reason` (so queued jobs skip, like F-255). Reading, search,
   export, member management, deletion, checkout and the billing portal stay open.
3. **Subscribing lifts it.** A live paid subscription (`subscription_service.live_subscription_for_organization`)
   overrides the trial at once; the checkout already works for a Free organization.
4. **Screens.** A trial banner with the days left (from day 5); after the end, owners get a
   full-page "Your trial has ended; choose a plan" with `PlanSelector`, others "Ask <owner> to
   subscribe" (`useAskPlanOwners`). The plan-allowance read (`GET /workspaces/{id}/usage/plan-allowance`)
   should carry `trial_ends_at` so every screen reads one source.
5. **Emails.** Two days before the end and on the day it ends (session 3 owns the templates).
6. **Tests.** Proven by failing tests first: the clock per owner account (a second organization does
   not restart it), each refused path after the end, the worker skip, subscribing lifting it, and
   a browser journey. The e2e Free tenant P must be seeded inside its trial (or with a fixed clock)
   so the existing Free-plan specs keep testing the Free limits.
7. **Docs.** Regenerate `docs/hardening/TENANCY-AND-PLANS.md` once the trial is in the code
   (`backend/scripts/generate_tenancy_doc.py`), and mark N-052 built.

## For session 2 (documents, AI, engines, background jobs)

_Nothing yet._

## For session 3 (organization, identity and governance consoles, security)

_Nothing yet._

## For session 4 (shell, experience, performance, operations, journeys, certification)

_Nothing yet._

## Session 1 → later sessions

Session 1 (tenancy, roles, plans, seats, billing, usage limits) fixed F-236 to F-255 and took the
product decisions N-040 to N-051 (NEEDS-OWNER.md, each marked `DECIDED (campaign session 1)`).
The generated source of truth for who a customer is, what each role and plan allows and how every
request resolves its organization and plan is `docs/hardening/TENANCY-AND-PLANS.md`
(regenerate with `python backend/scripts/generate_tenancy_doc.py`; a test fails when it drifts).

**Build on these (all sessions):**
- **Plans.** Free is deliberately small and charged at acceptance: 25 `document.upload`, 50
  `ocr.page` (reserved at upload, including documents still waiting for OCR), 30
  `assistant.message` a month, 10 MB files, 10 pages a document, 250 MB stored, one workspace,
  two seats, no API keys, webhooks, automations, batch or Business engines. One Free allowance per
  owner account (`quota_service.usage_pool`). Paid allowances are **per seat** (multiplied by the
  live subscription's seats). Plan limits are `limit.*` rows (`app/core/plan_limits.py`).
- **One admission point.** Every way a document enters goes through
  `app/services/plan_admission.py` (`admit_document`, `assert_reprocess_admitted`,
  `assert_workspace_available`, `admit_assistant_message`). A new intake path must call it; a
  refusal is a machine-readable 402 (`SPEND_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` / `PLAN_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` with `reason`,
  `limit_key`, `remedy`, `resets_at`).
- **New capability `capability.automations`** (Developer and up). The worker's automation handler
  and marketplace installs check it; a new automation entry point must too.
- **Seats.** Every way a person joins checks `seat_capacity_service` under the per-organization
  seat lock (take it before any invitation row lock). Owner, Admin and Billing buy seats
  (`PUT /organizations/{id}/billing/seats`, price shown first).
- **Worker gate.** `app/workers/tenant_gate.py` skips tenant-activity jobs for archived or
  suspended organizations and, now, for organizations read-only for non-payment
  (`BILLING_GATED_JOB_TYPES`). A new tenant job type belongs in `TENANT_ACTIVITY_JOB_TYPES`.
- **"Ask someone" names people.** `AskPlanOwners` / `useAskPlanOwners` (frontend) read the plan
  owners from the member-readable billing summary; use them instead of "ask an administrator".
- **Migrations.** Head is `s1b1_calendar_feed_org_member` (after `s1a1_upload_session_part_sizes`).
- **Seeds.** `seed_quota_tiers.py` and `seed_price_book.py --version auto` must be re-run on deploy
  (new tiers, the automations capability, Gemini overage rates); existing paid subscribers keep the
  version they bought (`--carry-forward` moves only to equal-or-better).

**For session 2 (documents, AI, engines, jobs):**
- Any new job type that does work for one tenant: add it to `TENANT_ACTIVITY_JOB_TYPES` (and it is
  then billing-gated too unless it is an export).
- Re-processing and packet splits already go through plan admission; a new engine that runs OCR or
  stores bytes must reserve through `plan_admission` rather than meter after the fact.
- Free-plan e2e tenant P is on Free: browser tests there only exercise refusals, never spend its
  allowance.

**For session 3 (consoles, identity, security):**
- `NoAccess` ("Contact an organization owner…") and `AccessRestricted` (`askWho` role names) still
  name roles, not people; `useAskPlanOwners` can supply names where the viewer is a member.
- Review-assignment and obligation ownership still require an explicit workspace grant (org
  owners/admins without one cannot be assigned); deliberate, but worth a product look.
- Rate limits are per IP and per API key; there is no per-tenant request limit for browser
  sessions (cost is bounded by the quotas). Decide whether one is needed.

**For session 4 (journeys, operations, certification):**
- **Owner actions before launch:** enable plan switching in the Stripe customer portal (N-050);
  publish yearly plan prices (N-051); re-run the seeds on deploy.
- F-256 (open, P3): late usage into an hour that had no earlier usage is not disclosed as late, so
  `test_late_usage_is_disclosed_rather_than_hidden` fails when it runs at minute 59. Reproduce by
  pinning that test's `now` to `datetime.now(timezone.utc).replace(minute=59, second=30) - timedelta(hours=1)`.
  The fix is in how rollup windows are sealed (a late event into an hour with no window should be
  disclosed too).
- Refunds are not modelled: a Stripe `charge.refunded` is recorded as "credit note not modelled",
  so invoices stay "paid" and RevOps revenue does not subtract refunds (Dodo, as merchant of
  record, owns refunds). Unverified how far this skews the revenue dashboard; needs a decision.
- The admin RevOps / COGS endpoints are proven to refuse tenants; their operator behaviour was not
  exercised end to end in session 1.

**Unfinished in session 1, and why:**
- Plan changes for paying customers go through the gateway's own portal (N-050); an in-app
  "change plan" that modifies the live subscription was not built, because it could not be
  verified without live gateway credentials.
- A second gateway subscription that somehow arrives anyway (e.g. completed from an old checkout
  tab opened before the first) still fails to record (one live subscription per account) and
  dead-letters; it is not refunded automatically. Rare after F-253; an alert and refund playbook
  would close it.
